          She looked at her student wondering if she could ever get through.
          "You need to learn to think for yourself," she wanted to tell him.
          "Your friends are holding you back and bringing you down." But she
          didn't because she knew his friends were all that he had and even if
          that meant a life of misery, he would never give them up The tree
          missed the days the kids used to come by and play. It still wore the
          tire swing the kids had put up in its branches years ago although both
          the tire and the rope had seen better days. The tree had watched all
          the kids in the neighborhood grow up and leave, and it wondered if
          there would ever be a time when another child played and laughed again
          under its branches. That was the hope that the tree wished every day
          as the swing gently swung empty in the wind.
